# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for [AoC 2021](https://adventofcode.com/), written in Kotlin 1.6.

Credit to my colleagues at Yoco for teaching me new tricks, optimisations and elegant functional solutions.

Also many lessons learnt from the [Jetbrains solutions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/advent-of-code.html)
to AoC 2020 and 2021.

To run tests:
```shell
gradlew 
```
